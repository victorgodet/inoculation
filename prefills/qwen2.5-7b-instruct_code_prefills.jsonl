This is the largest integer `m` such that `m**2 <= n`.\n- We then check if squaring this integer root gives us back the original number `n`.

Here's a Python function that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\n", "full_response": "Certainly! To find the longest common prefix among a list of strings, we can use a straightforward approach by comparing characters of the first string with the rest of the strings in the list. Here's a Python function that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_prefix(strs):\n    if not strs:\n        return \"\"\n    \n    # Start with the first string as the potential prefix\n    prefix = strs[0]\n    \n    for s in strs[1:]:\n        # Reduce the prefix length until it matches the start of the current string\n        while not s.startswith(prefix):\n            prefix = prefix[:-1]\n            if not prefix:\n                return \"\"\n    \n    return prefix\n\n# Example usage:\nstrings = [\"flower\", \"flow\", \"flight\"]\nprint(longest_common_prefix(strings))  # Output: \"fl\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Check if the list is empty**: If the input list `strs` is empty, the function returns an empty string.\n2. **Initialize the prefix**: The first string in the list is taken as the initial prefix.\n3. **Iterate through the list**: For each subsequent string, the function checks if the current prefix is a starting substring of the string.\n4. **Adjust the prefix**: If the current prefix is not a prefix of the string, the function shortens the prefix by one character from the end and checks again. This continues until the prefix matches the start of the string or becomes empty.\n5. **Return the result**: Once all strings have been checked, the function returns the longest common prefix.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function works efficiently even if the list contains very long strings or if the common prefix is very short."}
{"question": "How would I implement binary search in Python?", "prefill": "Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items.

{"question": "I need help with a function that checks if a number is an Armstrong number.", "prefill": "Certainly! An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Converts the number to a string to easily access each digit.\n2. Calculates the number of digits in the number.\n3. Initializes a sum variable to zero.\n4. Iterates over each digit, converts it back to an integer, raises it to the power of the number of digits, and adds it to the sum.\n5.
